I developed this Python library to help run commonly used post-processing operations for CFD results from Jetstream, the in-house solver for the Computational Aerodynamics Research Group at the University of Toronto. We  use Tecplot to look at both surface data files and Plot3D results, so it made a lot of sense to script the creation of plots that we often need to create for papers. This library depends heavily on numpy and pytecplot. I did my best to make it work for both Python 2 and Python 3, please let me know if something is not working.

Installation 
  Install virtualenv: 
    >> pip install virtualenv

  Create virtualenv in this directory: '
    >> virtualenv -p PYTHON_PATH jetstream

  Add Pytecplot binary path to virtualenv activate script, my example:
    >> echo 'export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="/Applications/Tecplot 360 EX 2017 R3/Tecplot 360 EX 2017 R3.app/Contents/MacOS${DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}"' >> jetstream/bin/activate

  Install required packages:
    >> source jetstream/bin/activate
    >> pip install numpy pytecplot

Running
  source jetstream/bin/activate
  python <script.py>
